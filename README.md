IR project 646 UMass

Please read the report for more context. The files are commented and proper references are present inside the .py files.
Each requires different versions of libraries. We would suggest to use miniconda environments. We ran on UMass gypsum clusters with GPU access (and the environment names we have used are also mentioned below). If you want to run the code, go to their requirements page and install it. Else shoot one of us an email.
